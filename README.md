## **Project Description**

This project analyzes a **Compound Poisson Process** S(t), where:

- The arrival process follows a **Poisson(λ)** model with exponential interarrival times.  
- Jump/claim sizes **Xᵢ** are **i.i.d. Exponential(μ)** random variables.  
- The aggregate process is defined as:
